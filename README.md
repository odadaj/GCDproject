This file contains the script run_analysis.R that downloads data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and does the following:<\b>
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<\br>
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<\br>
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<\br>
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<\br>
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each   activity and each subject.
